========
AllSpark is a siri for dumb phones. Built at APIcon 2014.

> Winner : Nexmo: Best Use
> Winner : Wit.AI: Best Use

AllSpark smartly understand what you're trying to say and gives you the correct answers, or lets your post to or read from twitter.
All without any internet connection, by using a smart bot on an actual phone call.

AllSpark also works via SMS, and through a web client (this one actually uses the internet)

AllSpark uses the following APIs to make things possible:

- Nexmo (for phone call and SMS interaction)
- Wit.AI (for natural language parsing in text and speech)
- Wolfram Alpha (for smart answers to trivia questions)
- Twitter (for twitter)
- Orchestrate (as the database for storing user data, like twitter API keys)

## Partial Success

We managed to almost integrate the Evernote and Wikipedia APIs for further power for the virtual assistant.

## Future

Due to it's modular architecture, AllSpark can easily be extended to support a whole variety of end-point APIs AND also enable all sorts of input mechanisms.
In the future, you can imagine using AllSpark to manage all sorts of things from Email and Calender to even controlling thinsg in your home.

We are also working on a better front-end that'll let you see rich data and manage your account.

## Contributions
Contributions in code and stars are both welcome. We hope to make AllSpark an open solution for everyone to hack on.
